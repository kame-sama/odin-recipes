    <p>
        Make gorditas at home with this easy masa dough. These little corn cakes puff up when fried and form a pocket for stuffing with cheese, beans, or just about anything!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup masa harina (instant corn masa mix)</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir masa harina, salt, and hot water together in a large bowl. Gradually mix in flour and shortening. If dough seems dry, add a little more hot water. Form dough into balls that will fit into the palm of your hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a work surface with waxed paper or plastic wrap; sprinkle with water. Flatten balls on the wet surface until about 1/4-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Cook gorditas on each side until they are cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat until hot. Fry each gordita until puffed, pressing it down into the oil occasionally with a spatula. Drain briefly on paper towels, cut the tips off and stuff full of your favorite foods.
