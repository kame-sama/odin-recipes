    <p>
        If you are looking for a delicious and easy way to beat the heat, you should try Okroshka, a cold soup of Russian origin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Okroshka is similar to other cold soups like Spanish Gazpacho or Bulgarian Tarator, but has a unique taste and texture since it combines raw and cooked ingredients.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s popular in Russia and various Eastern European countries, especially as a meal or appetizer in the summer since it’s perfect for cooling you down and filling you up.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, boiled and peeled</li>
        <li>1 pound sausage, e.g. bologna, frankfurters or similar</li>
        <li>5 eggs, hard-boiled and peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 pound cucumber</li>
        <li>1/2 cup radishes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the boiled and peeled potatoes and sausage into small cubes of about 1/3 inch each. Then add them to a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the boiled eggs and cucumber into the same size pieces as the potatoes and sausage. Add them to the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop the radishes and green onions and add them to the bowl as well. Season with salt and pepper.

        <li>
            Toss everything well to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, ladle some of the okroshka mixture into a bowl. Add about 1/2 cup kefir, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard and 1/3 cup water to each serving and mix well. For a tangier flavor, you can also add some lemon juice or sprinkle some citric acid over the okroshka.
