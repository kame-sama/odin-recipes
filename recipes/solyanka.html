        <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by pouring the beef broth into a saucepan and add the chicken breast as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            While you wait for the broth to boil, peel and dice the potatoes. Once the broth has come to a boil, add the diced potatoes to the saucepan as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a frying pan. When it is hot, add the diced chicken sausages, diced smoked pork sausages and cut boiled pork sausages. Fry them in olive oil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then reduce the heat, and add the fried smoked meats to the saucepan with the broth, chicken breast, and potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the same frying pan, add 1 more tablespoon of olive oil. Now sauté the chopped onions and diced pickles in olive oil for 5 minutes, stirring until the onions and pickles are soft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, add the tomato paste and half a cup of beef broth from the saucepan to the frying pan with the onions and pickles. Stir and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer the onions and pickles for 10 minutes, then pour the mixture into the saucepan with the solyanka.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the saucepan now add salt and pepper and cook for another 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before you turn off the heat, check the potatoes – they should be soft. At this stage, you can take out the boiled chicken breast, cut it into pieces and return it to the saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the solyanka with sour cream, lemon slices, green olives and fresh parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
